# Start of Development

I've created this website to be a personal resume as well as somewhere to describe challenges i've overcome whilst learning new
programming languages, frameworks and technologies. I'll be posting tutorials and example projects over the coming months and years.

Testing C Sharp Code:

```cs
using System.IO.Compression;

#pragma warning disable 414, 3021

namespace MyApplication
{
   [Obsolete("...")]
   class Program : IInterface
   {
      public static List<int> JustDoIt(int count)
      {
         Console.WriteLine($"Hello {Name}!");
         return new List<int>(new int[] { 1, 2, 3 })
      }
   }
}
```
